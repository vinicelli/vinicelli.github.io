## Analyzing and Interpreting Speech Patterns with Praat and Parselmouth

## Introduction
Praat is a popular software package mainly used for speech analysis. It has been around since 1995 and is still widely used in linguistics and NLP fields. While being consitently updated by its creators Paul Boersma and David Weenink of the University of Amsterdam, [its website](https://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/) is a mid-90s time capsule. Praat has a broad functionality, and supports spectrogram visualization, pitch tracking, formant analysis, and speech synthesis.

[Parselmouth](https://parselmouth.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is a Python library built specifically to interact with Praat and audio files, creating a seamless development environment to utilize the power of Python and Praat. The goal of Parselmouth is specifically to provide a "Pythonic" interface to Praat, rather than using the native C-based script that the software uses. 

In this tutorial I hope to give you a very brief look into the capabilities of Praat, and some strategies to use Parselmouth for NLP tasks.

## Requirements
In order to run the examples in this tutorial, you will need Python 3 or higher, Praat Version 6.03.09, and the Parsertongue Python Library installed on your machine. These were run within Jupyter notebooks in a native Linux environent (Ubuntu 20.04.6). All supplemental software referenced here is licensed under the GNU General Public License V3, and is open source. 

## Loading a Sound file Using Parselmouth
Parselmouth makes it very easy to load a sound file for analysis.

``` 
import parselmouth as pm

sound = pm.Sound(Test.wav) 
```
From there, the file is ready to be read and manipulated using Praat.

The included test file includes a short clip of me saying "This is a sentence I am recording for Praat." Feel free to use any audio file you'd like, but know that these programs are happiest when working with .wav files.

Here is an example of a variable made using Parselmouth's pitch method, which stores information about the pitch over the duration of the audio file.
```
pitch = sound.to_pitch()
print(pitch)
```

## Simple plots Using Matplotlib

We can use other common libraries like Matplotlib to visualize the recording, with things like spectrograms:
```
import parselmouth
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

voice = parselmouth.Sound("Test.wav")

spectrogram = voice.to_spectrogram()

plt.imshow(spectrogram.values.T, aspect='auto', origin='lower', cmap='jet')
plt.xlabel("Time (s)")
plt.ylabel("Frequency (Hz)")
plt.show()
```
![Output](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vinicelli/vinicelli.github.io/main/Spectrogram.png)

...or pitch contour plots:
```
pitch = voice.to_pitch()

# Get the pitch contour values and times
pitch_values = pitch.selected_array['frequency']
pitch_times = pitch.xs()

plt.plot(pitch_times, pitch_values, linewidth=2, color='black')
plt.xlabel("Time (s)")
plt.ylabel("Pitch (Hz)")
plt.show()
```
![Output](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vinicelli/vinicelli.github.io/main/Pitch_Contour.png)

...or simple waveform displays:
```
waveform = sound.values.T

duration = sound.duration

time = sound.xmin + np.arange(len(waveform)) / float(sound.sampling_frequency)

plt.plot(time, waveform, color='black')
plt.xlabel('Time (s)')
plt.ylabel('Amplitude')
plt.xlim([0, duration])
plt.show()
```
![Output](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vinicelli/vinicelli.github.io/main/Waveform.png)

We can also average measurements like pitch and formants across the span of a sound file. 
```
import numpy as np
pitch_values = pitch.selected_array['frequency']
mean_pitch = np.mean(pitch_values)

print(mean_pitch)
```
```
150.57656235439302
```
While averaging an entire sentence may not be very useful, averaging many individual waveform files split into single words or phonemes can be used as features for classifying the demographics of the speaker. The resulting values can be used for recognizing speech emotion, the identity of the speaker, or even regional accents.

## Displaying Formant Data as an Array
Here's a simple function to display formant data (visualized above) for  three formants at all of the key times stored in the formants object.
```
import parselmouth
import numpy as np

def display_formants(file_path):

    """
    Displays formants as F1, F2, and F3 at certain increments of time from an audio file.
    Input:  A file path
    Output: Prints an array of formants at increments of time
    """
    sound = parselmouth.Sound(file_path)

    formants = sound.to_formant_burg(max_number_of_formants=3)

    times = formants.xs()
    formant_values = np.array([[
    formants.get_value_at_time(1, t), 
    formants.get_value_at_time(2, t), 
    formants.get_value_at_time(3, t) 
    ] for t in times])

    print("Formant values:")
    for t, f1, f2, f3 in zip(times, formant_values[:,0], formant_values[:,1], formant_values[:,2]):
        print("Time: {:.3f}, F1: {:.2f}, F2: {:.2f}, F3: {:.2f}".format(t, f1, f2, f3))

display_formants("Test.wav")
```
```

```

Note that it is normal for formant calculations to include nan values, based on low input volume or noise.

From here, you could build prediction models for vowel or word prediction, or use silence data to split the .wav file up into individual phonemes, words, or phrases.
