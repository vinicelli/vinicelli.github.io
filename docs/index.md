## Introduction
Praat is a popular software package mainly used for speech analysis. It has been around since 1995 and is still widely used in linguistics and NLP fields. While being consitently updated by its creators Paul Boersma and David Weenink of the University of Amsterdam, [its website](https://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/) is a mid-90s time capsule. Praat has a broad functionality, and supports spectrogram visualization, pitch tracking, formant analysis, and speech synthesis.

Parsermouth is a Python library built specifically to interact with Praat and audio files, creating a seamless development environment to utilize the power of Python and Praat. 

In this tutorial I hope to give you a very brief look into the capabilities of Praat, and some strategies to use parsermouth for NLP tasks.
